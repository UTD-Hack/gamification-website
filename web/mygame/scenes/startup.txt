Day 1: You are starting out with $100,000 in your savings account. How do you plan on buying a house?

*choice
  #Use mortgage to cover up your costs
    You will be $50,000 in debt
    *set Debt +50000
    *finish
  #Buy it with your own money
    $50,000 has sucessfully been deducted from your savings account
    *set Savings -50000
    *finish
  #Rent out an apartment
    It isn't as comfortable as a house, but this'll still work. Luckily, only $2,000 have been deducted from my savings account.
    *set Savings -2000
    *set Comfort -15

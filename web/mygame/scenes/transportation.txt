  #Buying a Car
    It costs $20,000 to buy a car, but it sure is a lot more comfortable to riding a car than a public bus. Do you plan on using your savings to pay for it or use debt to pay for it?
    *set Comfort +20
    *choice
      #Loan
        You take out $20,000 loan to pay for it.
        *set Debt +20000
        *set Financial_Status (Savings/(Savings + Debt))*100
        *finish
      #Savings
        You take $20,000 out of your savings account to pay for it.
        *set Savings -20000
        *set Financial_Status (Savings/(Savings + Debt))*100
        *finish
  #Paying for weekly public transportation.
    It only costs $20 per week, which is a really good deal. Another week has gone by. Do you plan on continuing using public transporation or do you want to buy a car?
    *set Savings -20
    *choice
      #Continue using public transportation
        You pay another $20 for transportation. Oh no! You suddenly come home with a flu and feel really badly! Apparently, someone sitting next to you on the bus gave you the flu. What do you do?

        *set Health -20

          #Go see the doctor and pay $1000 because you don't have health insurance.
            You end up feeling a lot better.
